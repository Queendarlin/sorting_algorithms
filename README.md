# Sorting Algorithms & Big O Notation

This repository provides implementations and explanations of various sorting algorithms, along with an introduction to Big O notation.

## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### 3. Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items already examined and an unexamined sublist.

### 4. Merge Sort

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

### 5. Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

### 6. Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to build a max-heap and then sorts the heap.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument approaches infinity. It is commonly used to describe the performance or complexity of algorithms.

### Key Notations:

- **O(1):** Constant time complexity.
- **O(log n):** Logarithmic time complexity.
- **O(n):** Linear time complexity.
- **O(n log n):** Linearithmic time complexity.
- **O(n^2):** Quadratic time complexity.
- **O(2^n):** Exponential time complexity.
- **O(n!):** Factorial time complexity.
